Java User Group planner
=================

Do you want to organize a JUG session? 

But there are just too much things to decide and to agree on:

* what topics do you want to discuss?
* when should it take place?

This simple site helps you to do all this:

1. you can easily create voting polls
2. archive and search through old sessions 
3. get in touch with all the JUGers and send them an email notification
4. and many more (new features are being implemented "on-the-fly"... you know... agile development...)
 
 
 
Known issues:

 * strings are hard-coded (on client as well as server side)
 
Used DB : 
 - PostgreSQL

Used **Node.js** modules :
 - Express 3 + Jade
 - RSVP

Client side :
 - AngularJS + AngularUI
 - Bootstrap 3
